# FrequencyEstimation
A novel IIR filter implementation used for estimating and tracking the fundamental frequency and its harmonics

In many applications, a sinusoidal signal may be subjected to nonlinear effects in which possible harmonic frequency components are generated. In such an environment, we may want to estimate (track) the signal’s fundamental frequency as well as any harmonic frequencies. (Tan & Jiang) We aim to remove these components by implementing the algorithm from the paper “Novel Adaptive IIR Filter for Frequency Estimation and Tracking”.
